Peripheral drivers are frequently updated. We recommend STM32 developers to use the
latest STM32Cube software. It can be found at
https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-packages.html

Please note!
The STM32Cube sofware also includes many project examples. 
The SW4STM32 projects can normally be imported and converted into Atollic TrueSTUDIO projects.
